# Sound equalizer
### It is an application can be made for many reasons, relating to medical field, equalizer can be used to determine the gain of specific frequencies.
### in our task we are required to do an application that can divide the range of frequencies to 10 equal fields, than using 10 sliders we can change gain  value for each range from 0 to 5, also viewing spectrogram for each update automatically.
### and then we can change our intensity of spectrogram in order to have more focus on specific ranges.
## Here is an image for our working app showing the sliders, spectrogram,2 horizontal slider one for changing intensities for spectrogram and the upper one used to move on our signal manually, 2 comboboxes, one for changing speed of dynamic graph and the other for changing the color palette of spectrogram, and of course buttons which are used to change position and zooming,etc...
